# The Legendary Manager App

> The best to-do app everr

The app. React Native, GraphQL, Apollo Client.

## Getting started

This webapp is used together with [legendary-manager-api](https://github.com/cherrybeans/legendary-manager-api), so go ahead and set that one up if you want to run this properly.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to install [expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/installation) for this project, and I'm going to assume you have [node](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18-04) installed.

### Setting up

I use `yarn`, but you may use `npm` instead with the equivalent commands.

Clone the project and install dependencies as such:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:cherrybeans/legendary-manager-app.git # or if not using ssh git clone https://github.com/cherrybeans/legendary-manager-app.git
$ cd legendary-manager-app
$ yarn # install the project dependencies
```

Then you can run the app with with `expo start`, and open it up on your device though the `expo` app, or through a virtual device (which can be installed and run with Android Studio or Xcode).

### Useful scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `expo start`

The app will reload if you make changes to the code.
